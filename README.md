The current implementation has been developed in Python 3 and has been tested.

To view the documentation for function and other helpful information, read the [documentation](https://groupj.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

## Installation
Make sure you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

To check if you already have python3, use the following:
```bash
$ python3 --version
```


PLEASE note that almost all code needed to run the program is located in the game_platform.py file. This is becouse due to our limited lack of knowledge in python we had an issue with imports that we could not solve. We apologise for the messy code. Pleas contact us if you have any questions.

To run:
Run the following command in the terminal to start the CLI menu:
```bash
$ python3 source/game_platform.py
```
